//how to make a config file 
tsc --init

u wil get tsconfig.json file

//if u want to have all output file in one folder
in tsconfig.json file uncomment // "rootDir": "./", this folder tells which by-default folder need to be converted

"rootDir": "./src", type src

then uncomment // "outDir": "./",  which folder u want for output file 

example i want public folder to have output files
"outDir": "./public", 

on cmd
	tsc  //this will auto generate folder and files

..consider if u have .ts file out of src folder, typescript compiler will get confuse and create a js file in public folder i.e its covert the rootDir in public folder
to solve this
>>> in tsconfig.json file write
"include":['src'] //this will exclude other folder, js file won't be created for file not included in src
